## Introduction
Introduction is like a summary. It shouldn't be too long as we don't want to read an essay on a project. We should describe in an interesting manner what's the project aim, and what problems does a given application solve. Two or three sentences are enough in case of a small project.

If it's a training project, mention your incentive. Why did you want to create it? To learn a particular technology?

## Technologies
Project is created with: 
* Python 3.8
* Numpy 1.21.2
* Sklearn 0.24.1
* Pickle 4.0
* Hypothesis 6.29.3

## How to install

```
$ git clone 
```

## How to use
How to run a project? Does a project has minimum hardware requirements?
